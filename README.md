# Foundation Assessment of 2386 Liloa Rise

The house at 2386 Liloa Rise was build in 1922. The structure has held up pretty well in spite of its age. There are however some area of concern that the owners Dan Heslinga and Germaine Uehara would like inspected. 

This is a split-level structure with a pier and post foundation and crawl space. The foundation of the home is rock wall along the perimeter and pier and post in the crawl space. There are two piers that are cause for concern, pictured here: 

In addition there are two floor joists that appear to have been reinforced, as shown in these photos. 

There are not cracks in the wall or misaligned doors or windows. The floors seem level. 

##Scope of work

The owners would like to feel confident that the foundation is secure. We request an assessment of the areas of concern. In addition we request a general inspection of the remainder of the foundation and floor joists. The assessment should state any remedial work that needs to be done to secure the foundation an floor joists of the home--if any--and an estimate of the cost of this proposed work.
